# app
    
Generic Application to test core features that will be used across all Vargas Arts Applications. Also use it as an internal dashboard to test several ideas on myself before sharing wider.

Components and utilities developed within the `/app/package` are published as an `npm` package called `@dvargas92495/app`. This app also serves as the primary testing playground for the essential Vargas Arts web framework [FuegoJS](https://github.com/dvargas92495/fuegojs), a set of build tools build on top of `Remix` and `Terraform`.
